                  I thought that the cat’s incident would have no following. I live for another Caroline now, my Shiba dog who gives me the feeling of being loved. When those suitcase stealers moved in the building across the street, I couldn’t stop myself from spying on them. The cat never gets out of the apartment. The cat stealers seem harmless. But I fear that the cat’s value was greatly underestimated.

                  Every night it’s the same ruckus. People are gathering in front of their building. 48 that night, I count them. One of them gets downstairs, opens the door and the crowd disappears inside. I hear them after singing in strange languages I do not know. Hands are getting out of the windows, carrying beers, cigarettes or biscuits. Then, a golden glow floods the room. They all keep quiet. Silence for me and for them. Should I stay in the dark?

The entertainers’ phoney voices gather the crowd’s attention.  I watch as the curtains open revealing a box on an elevated platform. It opens and I see…How – How could I believe it? … Dead silence in the crowd and then cries… Cries of joy?

                  Things turned quiet again. The bustle of the last days transformed into a mind-numbing routine. Sometimes I see them outside without discerning a trace of enthusiasm or suspicion. However, nothing will make me forget what I saw. My heart is heavy, I am constantly on edge and the abandoned suitcase’s memory haunts me forever and ever in my head.
