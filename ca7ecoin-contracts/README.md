# Debugging instructions

## Install testing environments
```bash 
npm install -g truffle
```
Client to simulate real network (mining option possible) 
```bash
npm install -g ganache-cli
```

## Testing
run 
```bash
truffle compile
```
and 
```bash
truffle migrate
```

### Instructions
- Check if it's a problem with the configuration files of truffle (high probability)
- If yes, provide correct configuration to test it locally
